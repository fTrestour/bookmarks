All features that are implemented should be tested. They are tested using Bun's testing framework as [bun-apis.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/bun-apis.mdc) expects it.
Avoid mocks as much as possible, prefer a modular implementation that allows to inject another implementation in a service
Tests are collocated with the functions they test:

Don't:
```
blabla.ts
__tests__/blabla.test.ts
```

Do:
```
blabla.ts
blabla.test.ts
```

Use [utils.ts](mdc:src/__tests__/utils.ts) to to use a temporary db for testing as seen in [repository.test.ts](mdc:src/data/repository.test.ts)
